## Purpose:
The purpose of the project was to create a monster game using classes. The monsters would be created, and their life would be drained randomly until it reached zero. 

## Technologies Learned:

```
## What I learned:
This project introduced classes and class constructors. On top of that, it continued to build upon different array methods and objects.
